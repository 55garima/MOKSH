                    To see God, one must first have faith and be sincerely eager to experience His presence. This is not
                    a
                    frivolous or magical desire, but a serious one. It is important to understand that if God exists, we
                    must
                    seek Him out. There is a story that illustrates this point. A thief attended a public recitation of
                    the
                    Srimad-Bhagavatam and became interested in the description of Krishna, who was said to be adorned
                    with
                    valuable jewels while tending the cows in the forest. The thief decided to travel to Vrindavana to
                    rob
                    Krishna of his jewels. However, his real qualification was his intense desire to see Krishna. This
                    eagerness
                    led him to actually see Krishna, who played with him like a child. Through Krishna's association,
                    the
                    thief
                    was purified and became a devotee. Therefore, it is essential to somehow come into contact with
                    Krishna,
                    which will lead to purification.

                    It is a fact that nothing can be achieved without God's sanction. However, it is important to
                    understand
                    the
                    nature of this sanction. God is the creator and everything exists within Him. Therefore, it is
                    necessary
                    for
                    Him to give sanction. There is a story that illustrates this point. A thief prays to God to give him
                    the
                    opportunity to steal from a particular house, while the homeowner prays for protection. God, being
                    intelligent, is able to please both of them. He can give the thief the opportunity to steal while
                    also
                    protecting the homeowner's property. This is because both of them are praying and God must deal with
                    their
                    petitions. This is the position of God, who is situated in the hearts of all beings. Therefore, it
                    is
                    important to understand that everything happens according to God's will and we should always pray to
                    Him
                    for
                    guidance and protection. Hare Krishna.

                    This is not a fictional tale, but a true incident. Once, a man left his village and returned after
                    ten
                    years, boasting that he had achieved success in yoga. The villagers were curious and asked him what
                    yoga
                    practice he had learned. He claimed that he could walk on water. This statement attracted a large
                    crowd,
                    as
                    it would even today if someone made such a claim.

                    When it was time for him to demonstrate his ability to walk on water, an old man approached him and
                    said,
                    "Sir, it's worth only two paisa." The yogi was puzzled and asked why. The old man explained that he
                    could
                    simply take a boat across the river for the same price, so there was no real value in walking on
                    water.

                    Fair events also take place in Western countries, some in counties and some in villages. In India,
                    weekly
                    bazaars called hatta are held where salesmen gather with their goods and many buyers assemble, much
                    like
                    in
                    a marketplace. Thousands of people gather in these weekly markets, and one day an old lady from the
                    village
                    began to cry because she was worried about how she would accommodate all these people who needed a
                    place
                    to
                    sleep at night. Her son reassured her that everything would be arranged, but she continued to worry.
                    Later
                    that evening, her son showed her that all the people had been accommodated and provided with a place
                    to
                    sleep and eat. Just like this, even though there may be millions of living beings, God has made
                    arrangements
                    for their well-being.
